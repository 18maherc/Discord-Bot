----- Recent version changes for testing with Pragosh Test Bot -----

-- Version 1.4.2 beta
Confirmed that CC flow can be used as opposed to CAC flow which needs authorization which I still haven't figured out how to work with Heroku yet
Added back in recently deleted token get files. We'll have to keep these locally for testing and gitignore them in prod branch
